## Digit and Gender Classification on voice signals and LRP(layerwiser relevance propagation). All the work is based on the paper: the Interpreting and Explaining Deep Neural Networks for Classification of Audio Signals (https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03418).

### Dataset
The dataset consists of 30000 audio samples of spoken digits (0-9) of 60 different speakers. The raw aduio data can be donloaded in(https://github.com/soerenab/AudioMNIST/tree/master/data). The data will be stored in file "data"

There is one directory per speaker holding the audio recordings. 

Additionally "audioMNIST_meta.txt" provides meta information such as gender or age of each speaker. It is needed when processing the preprocess_data.py. The data will be splited into different file folders based on its classification task such as "digit" or "gender" and will be stored in the
